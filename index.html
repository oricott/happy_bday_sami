    <div style="padding: 40px;">    <p1>You're the best thing that has ever happened to me. You just have no idea how grateful I am for meeting you, for having you by my side, for all the times you comforted me when i needed someone the most. I'm sorry for not being that great of a boyfriend to you like I should be, I'm sorry for all the times we argued, for all the times I made you feel jealous, for all the times I made you cry. And I'm not just bluffing to flatter you, I really mean all of this. You know i mean it all. It's funny how even after being with you for two months now, its still hard to believe that we're both dating. From strangers to friends, from friends to best friends and then to lovers. Isn't that a little weird? But it feels right. It's a good type of weird. Jeez i waffled so much, but you just mean so much to me that i could just go on and on and just describe how perfect you are in my eyes. I hope you have an amazing birthday. I love you a lot.
     Signed yours truly, Dominic.</p1></div>
